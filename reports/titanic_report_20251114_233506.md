# Titanic Dataset Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Report

## Overview
This report presents an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the Titanic dataset, which contains information about passengers aboard the Titanic, including whether they survived the disaster. The analysis aims to uncover patterns in survival rates based on key features such as sex, passenger class, and port of embarkation.

## Missing Data Analysis
A review of the dataset reveals missing values in several columns:
- The 'Age' column has a notable proportion of missing values, which may affect age-related analyses.
- The 'Cabin' column contains substantial missingness, limiting its utility for analysis.
- The 'Embarked' column has a small number of missing entries.

Handling of missing data is crucial for accurate analysis, especially for features with significant gaps.

## Descriptive Statistics
Key statistics for numerical columns:
- **Age:** Mean = 29.7, Median = 28.0, Std = 14.5
- **Fare:** Mean = 32.2, Median = 14.5, Std = 49.7
- **SibSp (siblings/spouses aboard):** Mean = 0.52, Median = 0, Std = 1.10
- **Parch (parents/children aboard):** Mean = 0.38, Median = 0, Std = 0.81

Categorical features:
- **Sex:** 577 males, 314 females
- **Pclass:** 1st (216), 2nd (184), 3rd (491)
- **Embarked:** S (644), C (168), Q (77)

## Survival Comparisons

### By Sex
Survival rates differ markedly by sex:
- Female survival rate: 74%
- Male survival rate: 19%

### By Passenger Class
Survival rates by class:
- 1st Class: 63%
- 2nd Class: 47%
- 3rd Class: 24%

### By Embarked Port
Survival rates by port of embarkation:
- Cherbourg (C): 55%
- Queenstown (Q): 39%
- Southampton (S): 34%

## Key Insights
- Female passengers had a much higher survival rate than males.
- Passengers in 1st class were significantly more likely to survive than those in 2nd or 3rd class.
- The majority of missing data is concentrated in the 'Cabin' and 'Age' columns.
- Passengers who embarked at Cherbourg had the highest survival rate among embarkation ports.
- The age distribution is right-skewed, with most passengers between 20 and 40 years old.

## Conclusion
The EDA highlights strong associations between survival and features such as sex, passenger class, and port of embarkation. Addressing missing data, particularly for 'Age' and 'Cabin', is important for further analysis or predictive modeling.
