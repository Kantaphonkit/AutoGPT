# 🧪 AutoGPT vs Manual Data Analysis — Titanic Dataset

This project contains two experiments designed to explore and compare the capabilities of an AI Agent (AutoGPT) with a manually guided data analysis workflow.
The Titanic dataset is used as the case study.

### 🚀 Experiment 1: AutoGPT Completes a Data Analysis Report

Objective:
Experience the autonomous task planning and execution capabilities of an AI Agent.

Description:
AutoGPT is given the goal:

"Please analyze this dataset and generate a report containing key statistical information and visualizations."

AutoGPT then automatically:

  - Loads the Titanic dataset

  - Calculates descriptive statistics

  - Plots relationships (e.g., survival rate vs gender)

  - Summarizes findings into a report


This experiment highlights the strengths and weaknesses of autonomous data analysis performed by an AI Agent.

### 🔍 Experiment 2: Manual vs AI-Guided Analysis Comparison

Objective:
Develop an understanding of the capabilities and limitations of AI Agents by comparing them with a traditional manual analysis workflow.

Description:
You manually perform the same analysis tasks and compare the results with AutoGPT:

  ✔️ Steps taken

  ✔️ Time consumed

  ✔️ Depth of insights

  ✔️ Accuracy and correctness

  ✔️ Efficiency and clarity

This comparison helps reveal where AI Agents can genuinely improve productivity and where human judgment is still needed.

### 📌 Summary

This project demonstrates:

How AutoGPT behaves as an autonomous data analyst

How its generated report compares to a human-made report

The practical strengths and current challenges of AI Agents in data analysis

Useful for learning about AI Agents, autonomous workflows, and human–AI collaboration in data science.
